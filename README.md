# Introduction

This application was created during Trybe Back-end Module. It is a REST API developed with NodeJS, Express and Nodemon, in order to manager a store with products and sales. For the data manipulation, a MySQL database was used. Also for this project testing using Chai and Sinnon.

# Exploring the application

1) First of all clone the repository via <code> git clone </code>

2) Then install the dependencies, if they exist via <code>npm install</code>

3) Pay attention that you should create a .env file in the root for environment configuration. There some information regarding MySQL should be completed, such as: host, user, password and your port

4) To run the project just type <code>npm start</code>

5) Have fun 

# Updates

This project will receive updates as some tasks provided by Trybe are still incomplete and, let's be honest, it is always possible to do better. See you!
